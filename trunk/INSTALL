  daloRADIUS version 0.8 stable release
 by Liran Tal of Enginx <liran@enginx.com>
 =========================================



Prerequisites
=============

 Apache 1/2
 PHP 4/5
 PHP GD 
 MySQL 4/5

 daloRADIUS has been tested on Debian sid/unstable and Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 with apache2, php5 and mysql-server-5 packages but should be able to work
 on older versions of the mentioned packages (apache1, php4 or mysql4).

 Packages that has been tested are:

 apache2 	2.0.55-4ubuntu2.1
 php5 		5.1.2-1ubuntu3.6
 mysql5		5.0.22-0ubuntu6.06


 DEBIAN USERS
 ============

 For debian (or ubuntu) users I've put down a list of all packages which you need installed to get
 this running in even less time so that you don't have to spend time on figuring out which packages
 are required and which are not.

 apt-get install apache2
 apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5
 apt-get install php5-common php5-gd php5-mysql
 apt-get install mysql-server-5.0 

 Note: PHP installations are different on different systems, so please consult the OPTIONAL PHP CONFIGURATION section below
       if you have any problems.



Installation
============

 EXTRACT ARCHIVE
 ---------------
    daloRADIUS homepage is hosted on sourceforge at the address
    of http://sourceforge.net/projects/daloradius/ and you may
    get the latest release from there if you haven't already done so.

    extract the daloradius.tar.gz archive to /var/www

	tar -zxvf daloradius.tar.gz
	cp daloradius/ /var/www -R


 DATABASE SETUP
 --------------
    If you are working with FreeRADIUS and MySQL already then you
    probably have the radius database and corrosponding tables
    loaded up in MySQL. 
    If this is the case, you may use the daloradius.sql file to 
    load the other tables that daloRADIUS makes use of into the
    radius database.

    Incase that you do not have FreeRADIUS installed or haven't
    installed the radius database on your MySQL system then I
    have provided you with a sample file of my own test system
    that you can play with.


    If you have FreeRADIUS and MySQL with the radius database:

	cd /var/www/daloradius
	mysql -u root -p radius < daloradius.sql

    If you DONT HAVE FreeRADIUS and the radius database in MySQL:

	cd /var/www/daloradius
	mysqladmin create radius
	mysql -u root -p radius < daloradius-sample-data.sql


 DALORADIUS SETUP
 ----------------
    Almost done.
    Now, simply adjust the MySQL database information in 
    daloRADIUS's config file.

	cd /var/www/daloradius/library/
	vi daloradius.conf
   
    Fill in the database details and you're done.
    Save the file and exit.


 INSTALLATION COMPLETE
 ---------------------
    Surf to http://yourip/daloradius
    Login to the management:

	username: administrator
	password: radius

    These details are kept in the radius database, in the operators table
    incase you ever want to change it.


 
 [OPTIONAL PHP CONFIGURATION]
 ============================

 I have noticed that on Debian 4.0 (etch) when the php5-mysql package is installed the
 php.ini file is created with the extensions commented. To fix it just uncomment it, 
 like so:

    vi /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
    # comment out both of these as they are required:
    extension=mysql.so
    extension=gd.so
  
 Restart apache and everything should be ok.





Support
=======
 
 IRC chat available at #daloradius on freenode (irc.freenode.net)
 
 I haven't had time to put up a wiki or general page for this project
 but I will do it very soon, if there are any volunteers that can take
 this job on themselves I'll be glad. Hence, Forums and General Wiki
 will be available in the future at the address of http://daloradius.enginx.com

 I do my best to reply quickly to emails on my spare time, so if
 all else fails you may contact me at liran@enginx.com


 Sincerely,
 Liran Tal.
