  daloRADIUS version 0.9 stable release
 by Liran Tal of Enginx <liran@enginx.com>
 =========================================



Prerequisites
=============

 Apache 1/2
 PHP 4/5
 PHP GD 
 MySQL 4/5

 daloRADIUS has been tested on Debian sid/unstable and Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 with apache2, php5 and mysql-server-5 packages but should be able to work
 on older versions of the mentioned packages (apache1, php4 or mysql4).

 Packages that has been tested are:

 apache2 	2.0.55-4ubuntu2.1
 php5 		5.1.2-1ubuntu3.6
 mysql5		5.0.22-0ubuntu6.06


 
 daloRADIUS has also been deployed on Windows successfully and is under
 testing and more QA work, thanks to Gustavo Mariani.
 To see Gustavo's installation notes regarding a Microsoft Windows deployment
 please attend to INSTALL.win


 
 DEBIAN USERS
 ============

 For debian (or ubuntu) users I've put down a list of all packages which you need installed to get
 this running in even less time so that you don't have to spend time on figuring out which packages
 are required and which are not.

 apt-get install apache2
 apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5
 apt-get install php5-common php5-gd php5-mysql
 apt-get install mysql-server-5.0 

 Note: PHP installations are different on different systems, so please consult the OPTIONAL PHP CONFIGURATION section below
       if you have any problems.



Upgrading
=========

 UPGRADE PROCESS
 ---------------
    Upgrading is fairly easy and is do-able in a few quick steps:
	1. create a backup copy of the configuration file daloradius.conf which is
	   located in the library/ directory.
	2. extract the tar-ball (daloradius-X.Y.tar.gz) to the same directory of the 
	   previous copy, over-writing all the files.
	3. copy the back'ed up daloradius.conf over the one from the extracted archive
	4. if required, setup the permissions to daloradius.conf so that the webserver's
	   user/group has write access to it.



Installation
============

 EXTRACT ARCHIVE
 ---------------
    daloRADIUS homepage is hosted on sourceforge at the address
    of http://sourceforge.net/projects/daloradius/ and you may
    get the latest release from there if you haven't already done so.

    extract the daloradius.tar.gz archive to /var/www

	tar -zxvf daloradius.tar.gz
	cp daloradius/ /var/www -R
	
	
 Setting Permissions
 -------------------
	You also need to change permissions so that the webserver user and group are
	owning daloRADIUS's directory. In Debian the user and group are www-data and
	so we need to do this:
	
	chown www-data:www-data /var/www/daloradius -R
	chmod 644 /var/www/daloradius/library/daloradius.conf
	
	The chmod command is for having the daloradius.conf configuration file 
	writable by the webserver for easy administration from the Web interface.


 DATABASE SETUP
 --------------
    If you are working with FreeRADIUS and MySQL already then you
    probably have the radius database and corrosponding tables
    loaded up in MySQL. 
    If this is the case, you may use the daloradius.sql file to 
    load the other tables that daloRADIUS makes use of into the
    radius database.

    Incase that you do not have FreeRADIUS installed or haven't
    installed the radius database on your MySQL system then I
    have provided you with a sample file of my own test system
    that you can play with.


    If you have FreeRADIUS and MySQL with the radius database:

	cd /var/www/daloradius
	mysql -u root -p radius < daloradius.sql

    If you DONT HAVE FreeRADIUS and the radius database in MySQL:

	cd /var/www/daloradius
	mysqladmin create radius
	mysql -u root -p radius < daloradius-sample-data.sql


 DALORADIUS SETUP
 ----------------
    Almost done.
	
	GUI SETUP
	---------
	daloRADIUS has a Configuration screen from the GUI and so it
	is sometimes easier to set things up from the Web interface.
	
	- IMPORTANT: make sure that the file in library/daloradius.conf is writable
	  (and ofcourse readable) by the webserver user and group.
	- Browse to your daloRADIUS installation: http://server/daloradius/index.php
	- Login with the default administrator/radius
	- Go to Config menu item and set up the database

	MANAUL SETUP
	------------
	
    Now, simply adjust the MySQL database information in 
    daloRADIUS's config file.

	cd /var/www/daloradius/library/
	vi daloradius.conf
   
    Fill in the database details and you're done.
    Save the file and exit.


 INSTALLATION COMPLETE
 ---------------------
    Surf to http://yourip/daloradius
    Login to the management:

	username: administrator
	password: radius

    These details are kept in the radius database, in the operators table
    incase you ever want to change it.


 
 [OPTIONAL PHP CONFIGURATION]
 ============================

 I have noticed that on Debian 4.0 (etch) when the php5-mysql package is installed the
 php.ini file is created with the extensions commented. To fix it just uncomment it, 
 like so:

    vi /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
    # comment out both of these as they are required:
    extension=mysql.so
    extension=gd.so
  
 Restart apache and everything should be ok.
