   daloRADIUS version 0.9 stable release
  by Liran Tal of Enginx <liran@enginx.com>
 ===========================================



About
=====

 daloRADIUS is an advanced RADIUS web management application aimed at managing hotspots and 
 general-purpose ISP deployments. It features user management, graphical reporting, accounting, 
 a billing engine and integrates with GoogleMaps for geo-locating.

 daloRADIUS is written in PHP and JavaScript and utilizes a database abstraction
 layer which means that it supports many database systems, among them the popular
 MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sqlite, MsSQL, and many others.
 
 It is based on a FreeRADIUS deployment with a database server serving as the backend.
 Among other features it implements ACLs, GoogleMaps integration for locating 
 hotspots/access points visually and many more features.





Credits
=======

 daloRADIUS makes use of several third-party packages and I would like to thank these
 great tools and their authors for releasing such a good software to the community.

 datepicker PHP class	- Stefan Gabos <ix at nivelzero dot ro>
 libchart PHP class		- Jean-Marc Trémeaux <jm dot tremeaux at gmail dot com>
 
 Obsolete libraries:
 These graphical libraries for drawing charts were used in previous
 version, prior to 0.9 and so their credit remains:

 libgraph		- http://www.gerd-tentler.de/tools/phpgraphs/
 jpgraph		- http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/
