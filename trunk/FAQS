FAQs
====

1. After I login with the administrator account I receive an error page
   "Fatal error: Call to undefined function: mysql_connect()"

   This is because the mysql.so extension isn't loaded in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
   To fix it, edit that file and comment out the mysql.so and possibly the gd.so modules
   then restart apache2.
