release 0.9 - July 2007
	- thanks to Erick Otto the sql dump is fixed (there was a missing /)
	- added more management interfaces for radius's sql database (radgroupchk, etc)
	- moved to a more OOP design by moduling all the pages to use the same group-wise
	header menus which makes customizing and changing very easy and quick.
	- Evgeniy Kozhuhovskiy has introduced a new feature which enables support for multiple
	languages, also congrads for joining the development team :)
	


release 0.8 - May 2007
	- moved from using the Password attribute to the more widely accepted
	User-Password attribute as well as keeping compatibility with Password attribute
	- fixed mng-edit.php file to check if attribute exists on db and to
	create it if it doesn't (thanks ismail)
	- added more info in the README/INSTALL to make it easier to install
	- added premature initialization of several variables so that php's
	error handling E_STRICT or E_NOTICE isn't triggerd on some systems
	which have these turned on by default
	- moved to use isset() to be more compatible with php standards.
	- added for gis-main.php file opening check to make sure the file is writable
	by the webserver's user/group, an error message appears if there is a
	problem.
	- fixed small bug in mng-del.php where it wouldn't receive external
	values when called from other pages. 
	- moved to using a different date library, this one doesn't popup a
	window and should integrate good with most browsers as well.
	- as to request from ismail regarding interface colors I've changed
	all grey's to either white or black, as well as text in input boxs
	so it should be more easy on the eyes now :)
	- added javascript for showing/hiding input boxs in forms to give
	a more comfortable and professional look.
	- added to reports page per username another table to display the
	attributes for a certain user on both radcheck and radreply tables
	- fixed issues with un-initialized values in the $_REQUEST of several
	pages so now they check for a valid request (this prevents php notices
	to appear)
	- fixed problem in library/graph-alltime_upload.php where it didn't
	show the statistics for the year graph cause of a missing , (comma)
	- fixed in all the upload/download graphs the statistics to show the
	usage per the user that was entered in the inputbox and not the
	overall usage (this was confusing before but now it's fixed)
