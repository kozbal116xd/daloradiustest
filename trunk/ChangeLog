	languages, also congrads for joining the development team :)	
	- introduced new menu item - Config - where you can tweak the configuration of daloradius
	from the web gui instead of manually editing the file (notice that the filename and
	style was changed too to daloradius.conf in library/ so you need to migrate properly)

	nas page, radgroupreply page, radgroupcheck page and usergroup page
	- moved to a more OOP design by moduling all the pages to use the same group-wise
	header menus which makes customizing and changing very easy and quick.

	User-Password attribute as well as keeping compatibility with Password attribute

	values when called from other pages.

	window and should integrate good with most browsers as well.

	so it should be more easy on the eyes now :)

	a more comfortable and professional look.
	- added to reports page per username another table to display the
	attributes for a certain user on both radcheck and radreply tables

	show the statistics for the year graph cause of a missing , (comma)
	- fixed in all the upload/download graphs the statistics to show the
